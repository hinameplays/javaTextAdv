A simple Adventure game written in java using terminal out, see The Colossal Cave Adventure for comparable reference.

## important setup information

Because I have Visual Studio setup under Win10, I can only support it there for now. To run this one must have their path set to an appropriate JDK, in this case v.14.0.1  
Also there is some batch tomfuckery going on, so yeah
